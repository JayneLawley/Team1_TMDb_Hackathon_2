## Dataset Content
* This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) has the following characteristics:

- This dataset is split between 2 different CSV files:
 
| File                     | Size   | Columns | Rows |
|--------------------------|--------|---------|------|
| `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`  | 40.04MB| 3       | 4803 |
| `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`   | 5.7MB  | 20      | 4803 |

The dataset has many different variables that relate to the movie ranging from cast and genre to budget and revenue. We can use these variables to gain an understanding of each movie.

## Business Requirements
* Create a model that will predict the revenue generated by a movie so production companies can understand if their movie will be successful or unsuccessful.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* **Hypothesis 1:** Movies that get a lot of thumbs up (or votes average) are likely to be an indicator of movie success 
* **Hypothesis 2:** Movie success is influenced  by Cast
* **Hypothesis 3:** Movie success is influenced by Budget
* **Hyothesis 4:** Action movies have a higher likelihood of box office success
* **Hypothesis 5:** English Language movies are more likely to get higher ratings
* **Hypothesis 6:** There will be a difference in popularity between the genres


## Project Plan

* In the collection stage, two CSV files were downloaded from kaggle and was stored in the appropiate folder
* It was then loaded and merged into a single dataframe
* Multiple libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and plotly were used for analysis and visualisations
* Summarised findings and insights from hypothesis testing
* Handled missing values across multiple columns, converted data types to correct formats, flagged data quality issues
* Applied log tranformations and binned continous variables
* Saved the 2 datasets as a merged dataset, and after continued to clean the data and create a prepared csv for EDA
* EDA of Hypotheses of 1,3,4,5 using visualisations and statistical tests
* The chosen research methodologies were selected to ensure our code was robust and interpretable 
* We had a clear structure of ETL, Feature engineering, Visualisations in EDA and statistical tests to ensure our data was handled logically and effectively.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
* Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
* How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?

## Dashboard Design
* List all dashboard pages and their content, either blocks of information or widgets, like buttons, checkboxes, images, or any other item that your dashboard library supports.
* Later, during the project development, you may revisit your dashboard plan to update a given feature (for example, at the beginning of the project you were confident you would use a given plot to display an insight but subsequently you used another plot type).
* How were data insights communicated to technical and non-technical audiences?
* Explain how the dashboard was designed to communicate complex data insights to different audiences. 

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 

## Deployment
### Heroku

* The App live link is: https://YOUR_APP_NAME.herokuapp.com/ 
* Set the runtime.txt Python version to a [Heroku-20](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-support#supported-runtimes) stack currently supported version.
* The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.

1. Log in to Heroku and create an App
2. From the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
3. Select your repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
4. Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.
5. The deployment process should happen smoothly if all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
6. If the slug size is too large then add large files not required for the app to the .slugignore file.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
